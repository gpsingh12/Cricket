*There are a lot of fascinating facts about cricket and its origin.
The origin of cricket and its resembelance to baseball are the ones that
interests me a lot. While there are 29 established leagues and 500 cricket clubs
in United States, and the first internaational match was played betwee US and
Canada, still most of the people in US are unaware of this game.
But important thing is that while in most countries there is no one who knows
anything about Cricket, US being most diversely populated have the cricket clubs
and cricket is developing in US (``Having International Cricket team``).*
